## Context

### Question

Which method is used to bind external terminologies to archetype nodes?

### Outro

Terminology binding is crucial for ensuring semantic interoperability between OpenEHR systems and other healthcare information systems.

## Answers

* Direct insertion of codes into archetypes
* Using the 'term_bindings' section in archetypes
* Creating separate terminology archetypes
* Modifying the reference model to include terminologies

## Explanation

OpenEHR uses the 'term_bindings' section in archetypes to bind external terminologies. This allows for flexible integration of various coding systems while maintaining the archetype structure.

## Hint

Think about how OpenEHR maintains separation between its structure and external vocabularies.
