## Context

### Question

A multi-national research project wants to use OpenEHR for data collection across different countries with varying data protection laws. What approach best addresses this challenge?

### Outro

Balancing standardization with local requirements is a key challenge in global health informatics projects.

## Answers

* Use a single, standardized OpenEHR template for all countries, ignoring local law variations
* Create separate, country-specific OpenEHR implementations for each participating nation
* Use OpenEHR's archetype and template mechanism to create a core dataset, with country-specific extensions to meet local requirements
* Avoid using OpenEHR and opt for a custom, project-specific data model instead

## Explanation

The best approach is to use OpenEHR's archetype and template mechanism to create a core dataset, with country-specific extensions to meet local requirements. This allows for a standardized base of data collection while providing the flexibility to adhere to varying local data protection laws. It leverages OpenEHR's design for balancing standardization with localization.

## Hint

Think about how OpenEHR's architecture can allow for both standardization and customization to meet diverse requirements.
