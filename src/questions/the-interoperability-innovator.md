## Context

### Question

Which feature of OpenEHR primarily contributes to its interoperability capabilities?

### Outro

Interoperability is a key goal in healthcare IT. OpenEHR is one piece of the puzzle to achieving this goal. Other technologies, such as HL7 and DICOM, also play a role in interoperability.

## Answers

- Its use of a proprietary data format
- The separation of information models from clinical models
- Its reliance on a single, universal database system
- The requirement for all systems to use the same software

## Explanation

OpenEHR's separation of information models (reference model) from clinical models (archetypes and templates) is a key feature that contributes to its interoperability. This separation allows for shared understanding of clinical concepts across different systems and contexts.

## Hint

Consider how separating different aspects of the model might allow for flexibility and shared understanding.
