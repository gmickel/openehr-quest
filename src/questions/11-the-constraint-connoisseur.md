## Context

### Question

Which of the following is a valid way to constrain a quantity data type in an archetype?

## Answers

* Setting a specific value that must be used
* Defining a range of allowed values
* Specifying a list of allowed units
* All of the above

## Explanation

In OpenEHR archetypes, quantity data types can be constrained in multiple ways. You can set a specific value, define a range of allowed values, or specify a list of allowed units. Often, a combination of these constraints is used to precisely define the acceptable values for a quantity.

## Hint

Consider the various ways you might want to limit or specify how a quantity can be recorded in a clinical context.
