## Context

### Question

How does OpenEHR integrate with external terminology systems like SNOMED CT?

### Outro

Effective integration with standardized terminologies is crucial for semantic interoperability in healthcare systems.

## Answers

- It doesn't - OpenEHR uses its own terminology exclusively
- External terminologies replace OpenEHR archetypes
- Through terminology bindings in archetypes and templates
- By converting all external terms into OpenEHR-specific codes

## Explanation

OpenEHR integrates with external terminology systems like SNOMED CT through terminology bindings in archetypes and templates. This allows for the use of standardized codes and terms within the OpenEHR structure.

## Hint

Think about how OpenEHR might maintain its structure while still leveraging standardized medical terminologies.
