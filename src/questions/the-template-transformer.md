## Context

### Question

How do templates differ from archetypes in OpenEHR?

### Outro

Understanding the distinction and relationship between archetypes and templates is crucial for effective clinical modeling in OpenEHR.

## Answers

- Templates are used to create archetypes
- Templates combine and constrain archetypes for specific use cases
- Templates and archetypes are interchangeable terms
- Templates define the basic clinical concepts, while archetypes specialize them

## Explanation

In OpenEHR, templates are used to combine and constrain archetypes for specific use cases. They allow for the creation of purpose-specific data structures by selecting relevant parts of archetypes and applying additional constraints.

## Hint

Think about how you might need to adapt general clinical concepts for specific scenarios or forms.
