## Context

### Introduction

In this challenge, we'll explore some advanced programming concepts. Consider the following code:

```typescript
console.log('Hello, Alice!');
```

Lets get started with some advanced Python programming concepts.

### Question

What will be the output of this code?

```python
def decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Before function call")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("After function call")
        return result
    return wrapper

@decorator
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
```

Like that

### Outro

Understanding decorators is crucial for advanced Python programming.

## Answers

- Hello, Alice!
- Before function call

  Hello, Alice!
  This

  works
- Before function call
- ```typescript
  console.log('Hello, Alice!');
  ```

## Explanation

The correct output is:

```typescript
console.log('Hello, Alice!');
```

This is because the decorator wraps the original function, adding behavior before and after the function call.

## Hint

Pay attention to the order of execution in the decorator function.

The wrapper function is called first, which prints "Before function call", then it calls the original function, and finally prints "After function call".
