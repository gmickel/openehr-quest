## Context

### Question

Which of the following is NOT typically found at the root level of an OpenEHR composition?

## Answers

- context
- category
- content
- observation

## Explanation

In an OpenEHR composition, 'observation' is not typically found at the root level. The root level usually includes 'context', 'category', and 'content'. Observations and other clinical entry types are usually nested within the 'content' section.

## Hint

Think about the high-level structure of a composition and what elements define its overall properties.
