## Context

### Question

A hospital needs to create a discharge summary template that includes vital signs, medication list, and follow-up instructions. Which approach best utilizes OpenEHR principles?

## Answers

- Create a new archetype that combines all the required elements
- Use a template to constrain and combine existing archetypes for each section
- Directly store the discharge summary data in the EHR without using archetypes or templates
- Create separate templates for each section and link them in the EHR

## Explanation

The best approach is to use a template to constrain and combine existing archetypes. This allows reuse of established archetypes for vital signs, medications, and instructions, while tailoring them to the specific needs of a discharge summary. It maintains consistency and interoperability while meeting the specific use case.

## Hint

Think about how templates and archetypes work together, and the principle of reusing and constraining existing models.
