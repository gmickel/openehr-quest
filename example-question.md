## Context

### Introduction

Welcome to the Ultimate Coding Challenge! This quest will test your knowledge of **programming concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving skills**. Are you ready to prove your coding prowess?

Test of code highlighting:

inline code: `console.log('Hello, Alice!');`

```python
def decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Before function call")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("After function call")
        return result
    return wrapper
```

### Question

You're tasked with implementing a function to find the most frequent element in an array. The function should work efficiently for large arrays. Consider the following requirements:

1. The function should handle arrays of integers.
2. If there are multiple elements with the same highest frequency, return any one of them.
3. The function should have a time complexity better than O(n^2).

```go
func mostFrequent(arr []int) int {
	maxCount := 0
	result := arr[0]
	for i := range arr {
		count := 0
		for j := range arr {
			if arr[i] == arr[j] {
				count++
			}
		}
		if count > maxCount {
			maxCount = count
			result = arr[i]
		}
	}
	return result
}
```

How would you implement this function?

### Outro

__Efficient__ array manipulation and understanding of data structures are crucial skills for any programmer. This problem tests your ability to balance time complexity with code readability.

## Answers

- Use nested loops to count occurrences of each element:

```python
def most_frequent(arr):
    max_count = 0
    result = arr[0]
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        count = 0
        for j in range(len(arr)):
            if arr[i] == arr[j]:
                count += 1
        if count > max_count:
            max_count = count
            result = arr[i]
    return result
```

- Use a hash map to count occurrences in a single pass:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def most_frequent(arr):
    count = defaultdict(int)
    for num in arr:
        count[num] += 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```

- Sort the array and count consecutive elements:

```python
def most_frequent(arr):
    arr.sort()
    max_count = 1
    res = arr[0]
    curr_count = 1
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == arr[i-1]:
            curr_count += 1
        else:
            if curr_count > max_count:
                max_count = curr_count
                res = arr[i-1]
            curr_count = 1
    return res
```

- Use a set to eliminate duplicates, then count occurrences:

```python
def most_frequent(arr):
    return max(set(arr), key=arr.count)
```

## Explanation

The correct answer is option 2: Using a hash map to count occurrences in a single pass.

This solution is optimal because:

1. It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array.
2. It only requires a single pass through the array.
3. The space complexity is O(k), where k is the number of unique elements in the array.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. `defaultdict(int)` creates a dictionary where any new key is automatically initialized with a value of 0.
2. The loop `for num in arr:` iterates through each element in the array.
3. `count[num] += 1` increments the count for each number.
4. `max(count, key=count.get)` returns the key (number) with the highest count.

This solution efficiently handles large arrays and meets all the specified requirements.

## Hint

Think about data structures that allow for fast lookups and updates. How can you keep track of counts while only passing through the array once?
